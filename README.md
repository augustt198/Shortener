Shortener
===

Shortener is a Rails app for shortening links - provided you have a short domain

Shortener needs to connect to a MongoDB instance in order to work. To do this,
add the `config/mongoid.yml` file - an example can be found at
http://mongoid.org/en/mongoid/docs/installation.html#configuration.
